# Food Diary Helper

Food tracking apps are complicated. There are a lot of things that you have to 
input, measurements to take, quantities to fill in. This is great if you are 
preparing to be the next Mr. Olympia, but most of us just need a general idea
of whether we have gone over the mark for the day. We want to have a good 
general idea, and we don't want the hassle of complex metrics.

Enter the Food Diary Helper, an app for checking the amount of calories in the 
food we eat using natural language. Try Food Diary Helper, a simple calorie 
tracker powered by AI.
