Posting for social media is something that we know will grow our business. 
Whether we are markeing ourselves for a new job position, or posting our latest 
crochette pattern, posting to socials can have a major impact on our success. 
But regularly posting can be difficult. Some days we have time, and some days 
we don't! This is where Relay comes in. 

Relay is an app that lets you schedule posts for many major social media 
platforms. Relay also tracks the data on those posts and aggregates the data 
into a dashboard for easy visualizations of how people reacted to your posts so
that you can see what gains traction and what does not. Make your social life 
simple and more intentional with Relay!
