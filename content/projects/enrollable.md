Every school needs a way to get vital information from parents. But paper forms
are clunky to distribute and collect. Even if you manage to collect the data, 
you still need someone to do the data entry manually into your system. This is 
where Enrollable can help!

Enrollable allows you to create and send forms for users to fill out. All data 
is collected electronically and pulled into your system of choice. This lets 
you concentrate on how the data enables you to do what you actually want to do, 
which is know how to serve your school community.
