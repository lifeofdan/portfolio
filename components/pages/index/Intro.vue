      <h1>Hello!</h1>

      <p>
        My name is Daniel Newman and I am a software developer! I love all
        things code. My preferred stack includes VueJs and Elixir Phoenix or
        Laravel on the backend. If you take a look at my
        <NuxtLink to="https://github.com/lifeofdan" target="_blank">
          github</NuxtLink
        >, you will notice I like to play with a bit of everything. I think that
        is why it has taken me so long to build this portfolio site. There are
        just too many great tools to play with in your free time!

        During the day you can find me working on projects for
        <NuxtLink to="https://www.heretask.com/">HereTask</NuxtLink>. At night
        you will find me tinkering with just about anything. Whether it is
        bashing my head against Rust, enjoying the simplicity of Go, or just
        getting something done in PHP or JavaScript, I just love learning and
        building.
